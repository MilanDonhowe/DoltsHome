This is a Unity Game which I made whilst working in my, "Games Programming" class in the year of 2016-17, I just got around to uploaded the compiled game files here.  Whilst working on the game everyone had to keep and update a wordpress blog on how the project was going, you can read my blog [here](https://milanprogramming.wordpress.com/) so that you can see the development process.

## Gameplay

The game is fairly generic in terms of control.  You control Dolt using WASD to mvoe and walk over light blue platforms to jump.  There is a lot of bugs given that this was made by in just 2 semesters by high school student (me) with very little knowledge on any of the tools used at the time.

## Built With (copied from the blog)
* [Unity 3D Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/) – This is undeniably the most important tool I used, it is where I actually ended up making my game!  I made the levels, wrote the scripts, and even did the animations in this tool.  It is a remarkable game engine for making a 3D game.

* [FUNGUS Library](http://fungusgames.com/) – I used this for all of my text boxes, it was a amazing boon to my project, without it I doubt it would’ve been as nice looking as if I had just used GUI Text for the dialogue.

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) – I used this tool for constructing the majority of the 3D models in my game, the player character Dolt, the House, and essentially everything else that wasn’t a cube I used.

* [BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/) – I used this for the two audio sounds that weren’t the main music.  It is wonderful for sound creation, although only if your making a more simplistic game.  If you want realistic sounds you may want to look else where.

* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) – This was the file compression software I used.  It’s a great alternative to other programs like Winrar and doesn’t hound you to buy a paid version every five minutes.

* [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) – I actually made some of the text on the title screen of my game using this modeling software.  It is way easier to use than blender however not as “free”, luckily there is a thirty day free trial.  If I could do my project over again I may have used this program to create my level environments.

* [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) – This is a web-based sprite editor which I used to create the character sprites for the FUNGUS text-boxes.
